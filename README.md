# Mission-to-Mars

## Project Overview

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis. <br>
This project was about webscraping information about the planet Mars. In this challenge, I added pictures of hemispheres of Mars scraped from the web and added cleanly in a web page (flask app). 

## Resources
- Web Source: https://data-class-mars.s3.amazonaws.com/Mars/index.html, https://data-class-jpl-space.s3.amazonaws.com/JPL_Space/index.html, https://data-class-mars-facts.s3.amazonaws.com/Mars_Facts/index.html, https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars
- Software: Python, HTML, BeautifulSoup, Splinter

## Results
I used beautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape scrape-friendly websites about Mars. I used flask app to create the web application that put together all the scraped information and images.
